It is a professional implementation based on the article from Iran Macedo.
Theory “In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) [1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle&#39;s position and velocity.</description>
