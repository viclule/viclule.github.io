Hello there! I am a science enthusiast with extensive experience in algorithm and software development. Over ten years of experience, since 2016 focusing on python, rust and java related languages for microservices, backend and machine learning development, and deployment in the cloud.

I hold a BS in [mechanical engineering](http://itcelaya.edu.mx/), from the technical university of Celaya, Mexico, and a MS degree in mechatronics in 2010, from the technical university of Aachen ([FH Aachen](https://www.fh-aachen.de/)). Thanks to this I can understand engineering and computers.

For the first part of my carrer I focused in the developmet of algorithms for the alignment of optical components in optronic devices. First developing innovative technologies in [IPT](https://www.ipt.fraunhofer.de/en.html) Fraunhofer Institute and later bringing them to market with our industry partners.

Do you need help writing complex performant scientific code? Maybe I can be of help. 

Happily, I was accepted in [Mensa](https://www.mensa.org/) in 2018.
