Python is great! Yes, but sometimes the language just can not do things fast enough. Luckily, the Python Community is very dynamic and open to ideas to solve this. One of this, is to use Rust in combination with Python to accelerate your code.

I can help you to identify and migrate to Rust the sections of your code that would benefit from it, keeping a Python API to keep the life of your developers simple.

```python
print('rust can help!')
