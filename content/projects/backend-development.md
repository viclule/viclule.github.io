“In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components.

A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.” Wikipedia
